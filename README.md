## Technologies Used

The project is built using the **MERN Stack**, which includes:

- **MongoDB**: Stores user-submitted feedback and manages data persistence. The database is connected to the backend using Mongoose.
- **Express.js**: Handles API routing and server-side logic. It manages requests for retrieving cultural data and storing user feedback.
- **React.js**: Powers the frontend, ensuring an interactive and dynamic user experience. Components are designed to fetch and display data efficiently.
- **Node.js**: Runs the backend server and handles API requests between the frontend and database.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Provides a clean and responsive design for the UI, making the website visually appealing.
- **Vercel**: Used for deploying the frontend, ensuring the application is accessible online.
